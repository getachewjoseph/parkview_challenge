# Haptic Feedback Implementation

This document describes the haptic feedback implementation in the Parkview Challenger app.

## Overview

Haptic feedback has been added to enhance the user experience by providing tactile responses to user interactions. The implementation uses Expo Haptics and provides different types of feedback for various interactions.

## Installation

The haptic feedback functionality is implemented using `expo-haptics`:

```bash
npm install expo-haptics
```

## Implementation

### Haptics Utility (`lib/haptics.ts`)

The haptic feedback is centralized in a utility file that provides:

#### Basic Haptic Functions
- `haptics.light()` - Light impact for button presses, selections
- `haptics.medium()` - Medium impact for important actions, form submissions
- `haptics.heavy()` - Heavy impact for critical actions, errors
- `haptics.success()` - Success notification
- `haptics.warning()` - Warning notification
- `haptics.error()` - Error notification
- `haptics.selection()` - Selection feedback for pickers, toggles

#### Convenience Functions
- `hapticFeedback.buttonPress()` - Light feedback for button presses
- `hapticFeedback.formSubmit()` - Medium feedback for form submissions
- `hapticFeedback.success()` - Success feedback
- `hapticFeedback.error()` - Error feedback
- `hapticFeedback.warning()` - Warning feedback
- `hapticFeedback.toggle()` - Toggle/selection feedback
- `hapticFeedback.critical()` - Critical action feedback (like logging a fall)

## Usage Throughout the App

### Authentication Screens
- **Login Screen**: Haptic feedback on user type selection, login button press, and form submission
- **Signup Screen**: Haptic feedback on user type selection, signup button press, and form submission

### Main App Screens
- **Screening Screen**: Haptic feedback on Yes/No button selections, form submissions, and exercise logging
- **Fall Log Screen**: Haptic feedback on logging new falls (critical action) and button presses
- **Settings Screen**: Haptic feedback on toggle switches, button presses, and logout confirmation

### Navigation
- **Tab Navigation**: Light haptic feedback when switching between tabs

## Haptic Feedback Patterns

### Button Presses
- Light impact for most button interactions
- Used for navigation, selection, and general UI interactions

### Form Submissions
- Medium impact when submitting forms
- Provides feedback that the action is being processed

### Success/Error States
- Success notification for successful operations
- Error notification for failed operations
- Warning notification for important alerts

### Critical Actions
- Heavy impact for critical actions like logging falls
- Emphasizes the importance of the action

### Toggle/Selection
- Selection feedback for switches and toggles
- Provides immediate feedback for state changes

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: Provides immediate tactile feedback for user actions
2. **Accessibility**: Helps users with visual impairments understand interface changes
3. **Confirmation**: Users get confirmation that their actions were registered
4. **Error Prevention**: Different haptic patterns help users understand the outcome of their actions

## Platform Support

Haptic feedback works on:
- iOS devices with haptic engines (iPhone 7 and later)
- Android devices with vibration motors
- Web (no haptic feedback, gracefully degrades)

## Testing

To test haptic feedback:
1. Run the app on a physical device (haptics don't work in simulators)
2. Interact with buttons, forms, and navigation
3. Verify that appropriate haptic feedback is triggered for different actions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Custom haptic patterns for specific app features
- Haptic feedback for notifications
- Accessibility settings to adjust haptic intensity
- Haptic feedback for exercise completion and achievements
